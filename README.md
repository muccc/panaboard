Hardware:
- Panasonic Panaboard KX-B550S
- Raspberry Pi
- 5V/3.3V Level-Converter
- Some wireing

Goal:
The Goal of this project is, to grab the printer data during scanning and create an readable output file (png or pdf).
Additionaly it should still be possible to use the internal printer

Notes:
We use a version with a flex cable connection to the printer --> some soldering is needed.
